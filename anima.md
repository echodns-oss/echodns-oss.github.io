## Soul Synthesis
### Soul Synthesis: Anima
*An innate form of Soul Synthesis is not connected to any Precept and may have many levels or unique abilities to discover.*
**Level 0**
- Restores the function of the lost limb.
- Can be maintained indefinitely.
- However, void corruption is passively stimulated while in use, increasing with intensity of use.

**Level 1**
- SYNTHETIC MASTERY. With this benefit, Soul Synthesis: Anima no longer prevents Soul Synthesis with other spirits. At the current level, this restores the function of your lost limb in other Soul Synthesis forms, which gain a minor void aspect when in use. At higher levels, it allows you to activate boons granted by Soul Synthesis: Anima in other Soul Synthesis forms. While maintaining multiple Soul Synthesis forms, the burden of severe void corruption is shared with your partner spirit. The benefits and downsides of this effect need not be described.
