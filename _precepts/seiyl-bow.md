Pulling back on the bowstring synthesizes nearly invisible arrows made of nightborn mirrorglass, resulting in a functionally infinite supply of ammunition that is viciously effective against soft targets.

The projectile vanishes when fired, re-originating with an inverted trajectory from a short distance behind that which is fixed in the wielder's open eye. This allows the wielder to strike targets from behind and kill targets who wear hardened armor only in front, are inaccessible from natural angles, or have supernatural directional perception. The weapon's unique property results in three anomalous properties.

1) Firing the weapon at full draw into an empty space with no designated target, such as the night sky, results in instant death of the wielder. It is best safety practice to consider this effect invariable, even if supernaturally armored.
2) Firing into a normal mirror, which Seiyl calls 'stone glass', causes a violent explosion that extends into the Immaterial Mists.
3) Fixing one's aim on a target with omnidirectional perception causes the weapon to self-detonate, divesting the Cordis instantly.
