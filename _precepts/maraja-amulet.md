Emboldens the wearer's lifeforce with living water, improving toxin filtration and abeying the deleterious effects of mortal wounds. Pure water will seep from the wound instead of blood until the artifact's energy reserve is depleted; single instances of injury that would otherwise prove potentially fatal may become survivable as long as they are treated in this time span.
