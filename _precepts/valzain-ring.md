The gemstone shifts to reflect state of the local environment.

When in solitude in a non-hostile natural environment, the wearer can perform a short ritual that temporarily bonds them to the environment.
While it persists, the bond causes the environment itself to readily defend the wearer through physical means: the occurrence of serendipitous treefalls, sudden rockslides, avalanches, or plant growth causes the wearer to appear, while in battle, as though they are supernaturally lucky or possess precognitive abilities.
