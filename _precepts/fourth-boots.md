Unusual hoof-like boots that tread on a distorted plane, causing the wearer to levitate several inches in the air. To an observer, it appears as though the user is balancing with their feet on a pair of spherical fisheye lenses.

Compresses the local spatial frame of reference while walking. Each step travels a seemingly random distance, resulting in movement that is faster than normal on average. Allows for easy upright balancing on any surface that is not completely inverted, including fully vertical walls and steep cliffs. When moving off a normal plane, such as walking off a table or cliff, the user will continue to levitate at their current height for several seconds. Running is nearly impossible.
