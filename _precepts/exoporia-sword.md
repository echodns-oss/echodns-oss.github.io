Ultralight 'needle' sword of black fiber. Easily concealable and very suitable for piercing man-made armor.

Swinging the weapon scatters powdery scales which disperse light in the area. When the user snaps their fingers, the scales detonate in a burst of incandescence. In truth, this effect is purely illusory, though it is potent enough to blind and disorient creatures looking at or caught within the blast.
