Exotic weapon with twin gilded razor blades. The split conformation allows the wielder to glide a short distance.

When the blades are combined, the weapon can be thrown like a massive 'shuriken' with impressive cutting power; many mundane materials will be sliced through without interrupting its flight.

The weapon returns to the user when thrown, but watch out!
