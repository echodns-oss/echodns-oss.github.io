Scaled staff with feathery dendrites like a moth's antennae. The tip emits light, increasing in intensity with spiritual exertion, to blinding levels. The staff's holder appears healthier and less injured than their true appearance; this effect, of course, is purely illusory.

So long as they are not hostile to the holder, anyone that is guided by the light and accepts its guidance moves with abnormal alacrity and grace and is granted a preternatural danger sense that allows the detection of safe paths past harmful areas or incoming attacks.
