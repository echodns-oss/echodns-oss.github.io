Whip resembling the head of the Phytohydra, behaving more like a ball-and-chain mace than a whip.

Inflicts agonizing nettle stings on impact. The head of the whip is fully functional, allowing to bite and gnash at nearby creatures. Precept temporarily becomes abnormally powerful when gorged with fresh water.
