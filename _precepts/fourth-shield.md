Wide, durable disc. Loose objects passing the event horizon become invariably stuck, requiring incredible force to remove. Effective for disarming opponents, though the user's own strength must be able to support the additional mass.

Thrusting the shield forward violently releases all stuck objects.

'Violence is when an incomplete thought meets a sudden stop, Jehni.'
