Crackling amulet made of pure jagged lightning crystal. A storm rages within.

Three orbs of stable lightning orbit the user. The orbs can be used as a method of attack and defense and are able to protect the user forms of incoming harm. Once the orbs are destroyed, a significant delay is required before they can be reactivated.
