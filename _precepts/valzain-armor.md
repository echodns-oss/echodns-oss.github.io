Resists extreme temperature. Provides impressive camouflage in forested areas, even in winter. Frightens or compels lesser beasts.

Very effective defense against most mundane physical attacks, as the bark-like coat hardens in response to physical trauma. It serves as reactive armor against bludgeoning strikes, softening the blow with an explosion of icy splinters that can harm the attacker.
