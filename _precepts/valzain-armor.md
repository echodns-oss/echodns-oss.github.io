Resists extreme temperature. Provides impressive camouflage in forested areas, even in winter. Frightens or compels lesser beasts.

Very effective defense against most mundane physical attacks, as the bark-like coat hardens in response to physical trauma. It serves as reactive armor against bludgeoning strikes, softening the blow with an explosion of icy splinters that can harm the attacker.

The Precept physically resembles an artifact of the wild hunt: an illusion completed by the pelt of the winter wolf upon one shoulder. Valzain is inexplicably able to speak directly through the mouth of the wolf, an effect not typically seen in Precepts.
