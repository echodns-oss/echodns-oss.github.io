Fires small projectile bubbles. Low speed and travel distance makes them easily avoided by fast foes, but the presence of air currents can make them deceiving.

A target hit by a bubble is physically battered. Then, the bubble increases in size and rigidity to become suitable to contain them. In this state, while it lasts, it has properties similar to thick reinforced glass. It seems to mute sound, rendering a target who is unable to break through it temporarily pacified. Fluids pass through, meaning creatures cannot be asphyxiated within and creatures made of fluids can easily escape.
