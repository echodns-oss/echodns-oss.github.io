Smooth chitin mask with glowing eye-slits, covering the top half of the face. Augments voice, allowing the user to project their singing akin to a musical instrument.
Screaming at the top of one's lungs fires a heat beam powerful enough to melt rock. Extremely long effective range. However, sustained use, even over short periods, is greatly damaging to the wearer's mouth, throat, and eyes.
