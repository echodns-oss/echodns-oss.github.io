Unique and attractive crown that visibly marks the wearer as an ally and affiliate of water spirits while shrouding them in an aura of enticing mystery. The jellyfish-like crown is draped in a shoulder-length aurora veil that conceals the face unless parted. The veil protects the wearer from scorching climates, and biological targets other than the wearer that come into direct contact with it may be harmed.

Thoughts flow like unto pure river waters, affording limited protection from certain avenues of psychic attack including unnatural mental influence and domination. Telepathy is possible, though only when user and target are immersed in the same body of water. This effect projects only over short physical distances, but can be amplified vastly when two bodies of water are made one through the Border Immaterial.
