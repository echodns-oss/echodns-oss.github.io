Formal dress textured with the night sky. The pattern remains still as the wearer moves, resulting in an effect that is visually mystifying. Completely waterproof and highly resistant to stains.

Communication is conveyed over the vast space of the void: an aura of magnificence allows listeners in large rooms to clearly understand the wearer's normal speaking volume. A seemingly arbitrary number objects can be suspended in the air within arm's reach, where they will gently 'orbit' the wearer.

'Elegance is something that never disappoints the eye, Jehni.'
