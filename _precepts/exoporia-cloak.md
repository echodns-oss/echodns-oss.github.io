Durable and warm fur-lined hooded cape resembling the wings of Exoporia.

Allows erratic gliding. If utilized within twenty minutes of dusk or dawn, gliding becomes stable, well-ordered true flight while the sun or moon is visible. The flight is not exceptionally fast, but uses little physical or spiritual energy.

If the wearer is struck, the contents of the cage are revealed. The wearer explodes into a storm of fluttering moths which gradually disperse into nothingness until the wearer reforms at a nearby location. In truth, this effect is purely illusory; it provides no resistance to damage, and the conjured moths can be directed mentally while the wearer safely navigates away under a transient optical invisibility effect. Short cooldown.
