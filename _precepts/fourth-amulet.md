Swirling amulet that resembles a black hole. Has two effects:

1) Protects the wearer from the physical effects of spatial and gravitational anomalies. If an attempt to enter or travel through such an anomaly would cause harm, entry is prevented entirely, even if the event is conscious or deliberate.
2) Attempts to protect the wearer from harm caused by the gravitational component of projectiles. The effect is localized to the wearer's frame of reference. (This means that fall damage is not prevented.)
