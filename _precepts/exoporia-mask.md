Disfigured mask that covers only the bottom half of the face, making it appear as though the wearer's mouth opens horizontally (as though it were rotated 90 degrees). The effect abides when speaking, which may be seriously disturbing or frightening to anyone watching.

Strong emotions in the environment cause the projection of hallucinatory auras and terrain. The effect is normally visible only to the user, but they may attempt to impress the visions on nearby sentients en masse by psychically overpowering them. Individuals that are fully overpowered can be psychosomatically damaged by the projections, but in truth, this effect is purely illusory.
