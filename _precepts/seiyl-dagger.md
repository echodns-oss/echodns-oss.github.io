The edge of this dagger, which resembles a dark void in space where a knife should be, leaves a charcoal mark on most solid surfaces. While the Animist holds the dagger and has clear view of the mark, they become somewhat visually indistinct, and any sound they would make (extending to effects carried on their person) is silenced completely.

The mark disappears if unobserved. This property extends to the dagger, which is coincidentally well-balanced for throwing; in this case, it returns to the wielder's hand from any distance.
