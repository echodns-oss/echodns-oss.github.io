Full-sized two-handed reaper scythe of solid petrified wood. When held by the Animist, the plain appearance instead manifests a pseudo-elemental umbra resembling the season that best matches their mood. Mastery of meditation seems to confer some, but not total control of this power.

Each swing projects small amounts of corresponding effects onto the environment nearby: blooms of renewal, the sunfire of summer, dazzling leaves, or freezing winds. Striking a mortal blow against a creature causes a large profusion of the effect, which may make the nearby area difficult or dangerous to navigate.

Bypasses most material defenses when wielded against harmful invasive species in Anvar.
