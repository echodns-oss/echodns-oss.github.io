Decorative golden drakescale circlet with the living eye of a cliffscythe drake in the center. While the eye is open, the wearer may shout a short command; the eye will close, magnifying the wearer's voice. All mundane beasts within earshot will be compelled to obey, provided they are not immediately directly hostile to the user; those that are may stagger or give pause to consider it.

The eye will open again after a short period of rest - from a few minutes to an hour depending on the complexity of the order and the number of creatures arrested.
