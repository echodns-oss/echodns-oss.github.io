Spits seeds at a fully automatic rate of fire. The seeds are less than lethal, but exit the gun sufficiently hard and fast to be extremely painful and capable of causing injuries, stopping targets, or forcing targets to flee.

Provoking the gun causes the seeds to menace with sharp spikes for a short time. Once sufficiently upset, the gun will refuse to operate temporarily.
