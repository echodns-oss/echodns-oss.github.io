Long-tailed dress of gold scales that shifts to match the wearer's form and body-plan like a living organism. Well-armored and exquisitely regal.
The scales are razor-sharp. When worn with no other body armor, the dress can be weaponized in a whirling dance-like fighting style. The hem and sleeves cut like blades, while the scales - which regrow - can be fired as projectiles.
