All information contained within the book is visible only to the Animist that controls the Precept, as well as those that the Animist wills. Investment of the Cordis conveys additional, hidden pages to the back of the book in which supplementary information can be written or dictated. Seiyl serves as amanuensis, and will write upon these pages as fast as the holder can think; this supplementary information is bonded to the Cordis rather than the mundane item, and is maintained even if reinvested into a completely different book.

If lost or stolen, the invested artifact will surreptitiously return to the Animist's possession from any distance if unobserved. Despite all this, Seiyl does not seem to enjoy reading, and will typically excuse herself from helping the holder read the book or dictating the information within.
