Form-fitting black garment that covers most of the body, subduing the impression of anything worn beneath.

Any incoming object with mass is slowed down. The magnitude of the opposing force is proportional to the speed of the slowest part of the 'body of motion' to which the object is connected. This effect provides incredible levels of protection against projectiles, but only some armor against melee attacks. Against crushing attacks such as bites, it is actually worse than being unarmored.
