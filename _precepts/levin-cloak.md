Diaphonous cloak resembling lightning raging behind waves of flowing glass. The clasp is a fulgurite.

The wearer embodies lightning, becoming resistant to elemental attacks and able to deliver shocks to attackers. Movement of any type builds up unstable energy that can be discharged in the form of a thunderclap centered on the user or the manifestation of a state in which the user levitates briefly and emits uncontrolled harmful voltaic arcs to any nearby object or creature.
