Carbon black 'control rod'. The Animist may distort their apparent center of mass, as well as the apparent weight of the staff, allowing them to execute incredible feats of acrobatics.

Activating the staff can create a spatial distortion: a burdensome 'orb' that damages matter it collides with, a reverberant 'bloom' around which objects in motion may curve, or a 'pinch' that shortens the distance between two places.

'A path is something that's integral to the destination, Jehni.'
