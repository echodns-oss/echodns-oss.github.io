Twinblade forged of black metal of extraterrestrial origin, resembling meteor steel. The weapon, which loosens the wielder's gravitational frame of reference, seems to have a mind of its own in combat, evaluating each strike twice using two different sets of spatial assumptions and choosing the superior outcome.

The pairing of the blades is delocalized. Even when split apart, the user can control one from a distance by manipulating the other. The Dual Solution Principle can be invoked to alter the properties of latent space to match the specifications of impossible strikes, such as a simultaneous attack from two directions with no line of travel between them. Attacking in this way is crippling to the wielder's spiritual reserves.
