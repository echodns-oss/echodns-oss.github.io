Fires harmless gold tracer.

Hitting a target causes both the target and the user to lapse temporarily into a sequestered, selectively-permeable membrane of the Border Immaterial. Most attacks and abilities will have full effect on each other, but negligible effect on other objects and creatures. The state fades gradually over a handful of minutes rather than instantaneously.

No effect on subsentient targets or constructs.
