Projects a single phantasmagoric ray with potent stunning, hallucinogenic, or soporific effects, depending on the type of creature hit by the ray. Causes no physical damage and has no effect on environmental or subsentient targets. The poisoned sleep is restless and tormented invariably by nightmares.

Pulling the trigger once immediately divests the Cordis, which the weapon's nature seems to "remember" for a recovery period roughly equivalent to the effect's duration, an effect utterly unlike other Precepts you have seen so far. Attempting to recreate the same Precept before this period is over results in immediate, violent rejection.
