title: CALAMITY "Something that occurred inside"
essence: Exoporia
item: Slugthrower
layout: precept
---

Firearm made of insect parts, physically crawling with larvae and gore. In truth, this appearance is purely illusory. It is safe to handle, though the true form cannot be seen.

Fires a harmful flechette that draws on the holder's spiritual reserves rather than ammunition.

The effect of the Precept cannot be clearly characterized, but seems to induce an event of calamitous misfortune when fired at certain times. The effect is lensed around the target, but the misfortune is always returned to the user, most typically immediately afterward.
