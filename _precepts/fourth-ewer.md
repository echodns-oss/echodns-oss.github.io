A full ewer of water is slowly transformed into a foul medicinal substance resembling molasses. A sip cleanses the fog of illusion and deceit, greatly speeding recovery from mind-altering effects, and may help the receiver connect distant ideas or overcome creative blocks. Anointing a willing creature in ablution, or applying the substance to an object appears to greatly reduce the subject's weight for a short time.

Setting 199 completely upside-down instantly causes a localized gravitational collapse that can crush objects, structures, and entities in the immediate area. The user is not immune to this effect.

'Confusion is something I don't understand, Jehni.'
