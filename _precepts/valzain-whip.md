A weapon's name that seldom disappoints the aim. 

Guides the user in tripping, ensnaring, or disarming opponents, as well as swinging from protruding terrain or retrieving objects from afar. By performing a battledance, bursts of freezing mist can be conjured that can harm enemies or allow safe travel across the surface of water. The whip can change rapidly in length at a thought. It can be disguised as a rod, a branch, or an icy sword, but loses most supernatural properties in any of these forms.

If a living creature is fully restrained by the whip, you may attempt to impress upon them a terrible witching frost that results in gruesome death. The certainty of this effect is massively diminished in the absence of the user's absolute, unflinching desire to kill their target; the sylvan, you see, is oft-willing to grant second chances even to the least of creatures.
