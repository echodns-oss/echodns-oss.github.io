Nourishes life, slowly utilizing elemental power to accelerate natural healing processes of all living things within the user's splendor. Minor normal wounds will close quickly, plants will rehydrate, onset of fatigue will be slowed, and fatigue recovery will be quickened. The effect is applied in parallel to all entities within the area of influence, and does not directly discriminate between friendly and hostile targets.

Direct concentration confers limited control of environmental water, which can be used to bathe wounds or wielded against enemies in a lesser capacity. This ability exhausts spiritual potency at an alarming rate.
