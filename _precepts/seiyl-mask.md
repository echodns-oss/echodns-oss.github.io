The Animist can devour spoken and written words. By focusing on an individual within range, that individual's speech is muted to all but the wearer; focusing on written text scours ink from the page. When the wearer becomes gorged on a target's words in a single sitting, they become metaphysically disguised as that individual for a short time. The illusion is broken easily at very short range, especially by direct touch.
