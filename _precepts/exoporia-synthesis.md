A spirit fruit can be consumed to convey Soul Synthesis 1 for approximately one hour. Consumption renders the relevant Cordis unusable for 24-36 hours.

## Soul Synthesis Abilities
**Level 1**
The spirit has no charisma. At this level, it bends completely to your will and its use confers low corruption.
The wearer gains a moth-like aspect, including the following properties
- Perfect night vision.
- Low altitude flight.
- Shed scales to create kaleidoscopic field. Greatly empowers the effect of other illusion-based abilities, allowing them to project potent images into empty space; alone, it is only somewhat mystifying. Can also deflect or redirect light-based attacks.
- The moth's antennae can fire an incandescent ray. Rapidly exhausts Soul Synthesis duration.
- The user is enchanted by fire, but becomes extremely flammable in this state.

(Higher levels of Soul Synthesis may be available.)
